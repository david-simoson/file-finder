**Finder**
The purpose of this project is to allow the user to easily search directories for files containing search strings.

**Setup**
The intended usage that the executable is placed in a directory for general purpose utilities - if this directory has not already been added to the PATH in environment variables, then do so. If you do no do so the executable will need to be placed into each folder it is run in.

**Usage**
To perform a search of a directory open a command prompt to that directory and type the executable name followed by the search string, i.e:

finder testSearchString

This will search the directory for all files which contain the string "testSearchString" and return the results.
